## Inspiration
Old age has always been here with us. To live, one should be aware of death, and to die, one should have lived. But in between living and dying, there is aging. There have been many attempts to escape it; we have cosmetic surgery, daily routines to prevent the effects of aging et cetera, but it was never a question of when and where. We know that it is coming, and we may delay the inevitable, but we cannot stop it. Therefore, instead we should explore the how. How can we reduce the problems brought about by aging?  When you and I get old, we will start to have difficulties moving. The slow wear in our mobility may make us feel helpless. We may be taken advantaged of, we may feel insecure by the restriction in our movement which we have always took for granted; the very movement which grants us a part of our human agency. The fact that the effects are unavoidable is what makes the necessity of tackling the burdens paramount.
