# Code Repo of QWERTY in MLDA 2022 Hackathon
## Topic: Mobot for better lifecare 
### Part1: 3D-printed Robot Hand
- To help the senior and disabled with moving hands 
- Similar size and as human hands
- Complete and flexible joints

### Part2: Vision-based manipulation
- Use Yolo-v5 and Jetson Nano
- Estimate objects' distances

### Part3: Voice control and face detection
- A constant monitoring system and safeguard
- Voice-based initiation and termination

### Part4: EEG auxiliary monitoring system
- Serve as an addtional input to monitor the host`s health condition

## Inspiration
Old age has always been here with us. To live, one should be aware of death, and to die, one should have lived. But in between living and dying, there is aging. There have been many attempts to escape it; we have cosmetic surgery, daily routines to prevent the effects of aging et cetera, but it was never a question of when and where. We know that it is coming, and we may delay the inevitable, but we cannot stop it. Therefore, instead we should explore the how. How can we reduce the problems brought about by aging?  When you and I get old, we will start to have difficulties moving. The slow wear in our mobility may make us feel helpless. We may be taken advantaged of, we may feel insecure by the restriction in our movement which we have always took for granted; the very movement which grants us a part of our human agency. The fact that the effects are unavoidable is what makes the necessity of tackling the burdens paramount.

## What it does
We provide a general lifecare support system. The robotic hand can aid the people in need with mobility. The face detection and voice control program provides convient and consistant safety monitoring. And the EEG system offers additional information regarding health.
## How we built it
The robotic hand is made with 3d-printing. The joints are linked with scilicon, and are bended with servos and wires.
## Challenges we ran into
Hard to build up the robotic hand, the printed product is rought in the surface. Hard to run multiple tasks on Jetson Nano due to limited RAM.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Highly functional and realistic robot hand. Robust and complete computer vision and audio supporting system. The general design am implementation of the system. The efficient collaboration among our teammates. 
## What we learned
Teamwork.
## What's next for MOBOT
More robust remote communication system. Synchronize vision and audio input and robotic hand movement.
